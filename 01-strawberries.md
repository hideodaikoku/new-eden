# strawberries
![strawberries](images/strawberries.jpeg)

I dream of days when. 
I can no longer remember. 
The sound of radio chatter. 
Like light through an open window. 
After seven weeks of rain,. 
Like running barefoot on sand . 
After weeks of broken concrete,. 
The scent of incense. 
In the unholiest of places,. 
Like a familiar smile. 
On unfamiliar faces,. 
I dream of a world. 
Where I long for the taste of strawberries..
