# the general theory of specificity
![the general theory of specificity](images/the%20general%20theory%20of%20specificity.jpeg)

grand unification<br/>
of the seven nations<br/>
did you hear it on the media station?<br/>
it’s clearer when you’re at an elevation<br/>
that’s when you can really read the equation<br/>
when space and time take a vacation<br/>
enough room to read the situation<br/>
up-quarks in quiet elation<br/>
a microcosm on probation
