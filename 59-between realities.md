# between realities
![between realities](images/between%20realities.jpeg)

I opened the third<br/>
and could not close it<br/>
i took the red pill<br/>
to seek the yellow one<br/>
i opened both doors<br/>
only to stay inside::<br/>
disintegrate into<br/>
the depths<br/>
of a deeper blue.<br/>
everything connects.
