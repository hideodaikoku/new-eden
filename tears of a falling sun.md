*Image: John Fruscianteâ€™s Enclosure*

your mind is a
self-inscribing enclosure
twisting and turning, 
yet still breathing
sometimes moving, 
sometimes suspended
i wish you could see 
the water at its source
what was once pure now full
of sediment in sentiment
cool fluid at the 
troughs of your hands
yet all you see is a reflection
of the people you 
wished we could be
but what good is an image
without the light of a falling sun?
