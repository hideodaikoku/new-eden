# instant karma

the weather report told me
of how the policeman’s son
had a criminal habit
and the physician’s daughter
became a liberal martyr
how my neighborhood stationer
became a store of inconvenience
how the young chess prodigy 
now works in construction
and the former tech 
billionaire now lives 
in the countryside
baking donuts, and 
lemon meringue pie
