*Ceramics by James Opp√©*

soil from the earth</br>
mixed with sand</br>
water and few drops</br>
of bottled dust</br>
placed on a rotating</br>
flat, disk, one day at a time</br>
gently guiding the land</br>
few drops of sunlight</br>
a guided kiln, lit by charcoal from pine trees</br>
glaze with rocks from deep below</br>
and cooled under</br>
the shade of cedar trees</br>
so we may drink tea, wind down</br>
and bask in the sunset
