*Ceramics by James Opp√©*

soil from the earth
mixed with sand
water and few drops
of bottled dust
placed on a rotating
flat, disk, one day at a time
gently guiding the land
few drops of sunlight
a guided kiln, lit by charcoal from pine trees
glaze with rocks from deep below
and cooled under 
the shade of cedar trees
so we may drink tea, wind down
and bask in the sunset
