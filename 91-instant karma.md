# instant karma
![instant karma](images/instant%20karma.png)

the weather report told me<br/>
of how the policeman’s son<br/>
had a criminal habit<br/>
and the physician’s daughter<br/>
became a liberal martyr<br/>
how my neighborhood stationer<br/>
became a store of inconvenience<br/>
how the young chess prodigy<br/>
now works in construction<br/>
and the former tech<br/> 
billionaire now lives <br/>
in the countryside<br/>
baking donuts, and<br/> 
lemon meringue pie
