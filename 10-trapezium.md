reality is held in balance by
just a few strings, connecting stars in the sky
mankind’s quest for meaning
reveal three thousand realms
in a single moment
or maybe, infinity in a grain of sand
but we all prefer to keep our
third eye blind
wear faces in passing
“Hello, How do you do?”
hiding subtle grins
at the fatalism of it all
that reality might be
but three steps away from the closest
phone booth, dial the number
exitsimulation
