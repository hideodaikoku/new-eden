# minus one

![minus one](images/minus%20one.jpeg)

the monster came
and tore apart
the walls of the village
that was once peaceful,
but now divided
the villagers scared
arrows, traps, sticks and stones,
they used to hurt the beast
so with one last atomic breath,
the beast cried, then turned his back 
and walked to the ocean
leaving destruction in his path
so the townspeople could
rebuild the shoreline
and protect themselves
from the storm to come
