# minus one

![minus one](images/minus%20one.jpeg)

the monster came</br>
and tore apart</br>
the walls of the village</br>
that was once peaceful,</br>
but now divided</br>
the villagers scared</br>
arrows, traps, sticks and stones,</br>
they used to hurt the beast</br>
so with one last atomic breath,</br>
the beast cried, then turned his back </br>
and walked to the ocean</br>
leaving destruction in his path</br>
so the townspeople could</br>
rebuild the shoreline</br>
and protect themselves</br>
from the storm to come
