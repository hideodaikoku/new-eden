snow is falling in our backyard 
and the words on the page 
slowly melt into tiny
puddles of footprints 
to my heart
:: they tell me that
when I’m 101 i’d still be
a teenage citizen
full of wonder,
wild and peaceful
as an animated character
on the back of a cereal box
behind a sunday morning 
cartoon about dinosaurs
