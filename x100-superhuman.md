snow is falling in our backyard<br/> 
and the words on the page<br/> 
slowly melt into tiny<br/>
puddles of footprints<br/> 
to my heart<br/>
:: they tell me that<br/>
when I’m 101 i’d still be<br/>
a teenage citizen<br/>
full of wonder,<br/>
wild and peaceful<br/>
as an animated character<br/>
on the back of a cereal box<br/>
behind a sunday morning<br/> 
cartoon about dinosaurs
