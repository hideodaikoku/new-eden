## shoreline
![shoreline](images/shoreline.jpeg)

a fishing boat<br/>
with two oars and a<br/> 
hole in the bottom<br/>
rocked by salty waves<br/>
of sea water<br/> 
floating to the shoreline<br/>
slowly sinking<br/>
I wonder if you mistook me<br/>
for the light house or<br/>
gust of wind<br/>
I am the ocean
