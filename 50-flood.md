# flood
![flood](images/flood.jpeg)

hush now, madam nurse<br/>
Is in the wilderness<br/>
white lanterns lit by<br/>
the children of the forest<br/>
three arrows in her left arm<br/>
and the trails that follow<br/>
dusk hides her sighs<br/>
from red flood<br/>
and fire in the sky<br/>
the river reflects<br/>
her sin
