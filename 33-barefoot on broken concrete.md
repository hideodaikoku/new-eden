## barefoot on broken concrete
![barefoot on broken concrete](images/barefoot%20on%20broken%20concrete.jpeg)

vanilla pavement against the scent of gently seasoned tarmac 
With my bare feet on the bare ground
We touch and I shudder as if 
my hand brushed a lovers
Concrete stones nest themselves between
My mono hominid toes without the unkind obstruction
Of uncomfortable shoes
I feel the earth play its rhythm
