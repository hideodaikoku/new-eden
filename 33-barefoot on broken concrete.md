## barefoot on broken concrete
![barefoot on broken concrete](images/barefoot%20on%20broken%20concrete.jpeg)

vanilla pavement against the scent of gently seasoned tarmac<br/> 
With my bare feet on the bare ground<br/>
We touch and I shudder as if <br/>
my hand brushed a lovers<br/>
Concrete stones nest themselves between<br/>
My mono hominid toes without the unkind obstruction<br/>
Of uncomfortable shoes<br/>
I feel the earth play its rhythm<br/>
