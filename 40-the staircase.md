*M.C Escher, Relativity (1953)*

the spiral is far from
a loop, echoing a legend of
the boy, the sword
and the mountain
we wander, in order
to start at the finish line
thereâ€™s footprints 
when we look back
the staircase shifts form 
when we look ahead
cracks in the landing
give way to the rose that grew
from the concreteq
