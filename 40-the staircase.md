*M.C Escher, Relativity (1953)*

the spiral is far from<br/>
a loop, echoing a legend of<br/>
the boy, the sword<br/>
and the mountain<br/>
we wander, in order<br/>
to start at the finish line<br/>
thereâ€™s footprints<br/> 
when we look back<br/>
the staircase shifts form <br/>
when we look ahead<br/>
cracks in the landing<br/>
give way to the rose that grew<br/>
from the concrete
