# unidentified flowing objects
![unidentified flowing objects](images/unidentified%20flowing%20objects.jpeg)

three rivers that met<br/>
in the depths of the inferno<br/>
one for double; two for trouble<br/> 
a third for all the boil and bubble<br/>
and in the middle was fire and stone<br/>
a beacon of light that painted<br/>
a silver cross, ascension to a higher form<br/>
of eternal knowledge, the wisdom of the<br/> ancient sacred land, and sacred space<br/>
the burning fields of this inverted world<br/>
where down below was the vast emptiness<br/>
of the cosmos and up above<br/>
are unidentified flowing objects<br/>
back to the place where three rivers meet<br/>
pleasure, pain and sin<br/>
anger, fear and resentment<br/>
beauty, growth and envy<br/>
cherish what cannot be saved<br/>
and save what cannot be cherished<br/>
ash and sinew, ready yourself for th<br/>e
long winter
