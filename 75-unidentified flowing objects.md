# unidentified flowing objects
![unidentified flowing objects](images/unidentified%20flowing%20objects.jpeg)

three rivers that met
in the depths of the inferno
one for double; two for trouble 
a third for all the boil and bubble
and in the middle was fire and stone
a beacon of light that painted
a silver cross, ascension to a higher form
of eternal knowledge, the wisdom of the ancient sacred land, and sacred space
the burning fields of this inverted world
where down below was the vast emptiness
of the cosmos and up above
are unidentified flowing objects
back to the place where three rivers meet
pleasure, pain and sin
anger, fear and resentment
beauty, growth and envy
cherish what cannot be saved
and save what cannot be cherished
ash and sinew, ready yourself for the
long winter
