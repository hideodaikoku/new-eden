# waxing and wailing
![waxing and wailing](images/waxing%20and%20wailing.jpeg)

on a precipice
night in and day out
far from the moon
waxing the floor till it wanes
lone wolf
raises his head
screaming into the abyss
we sit quietly
modulate the echoes
filter the noise
and see the Void
for what it truly is
the beauty and the pain
