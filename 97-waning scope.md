# waning scope
![waning scope](images/waning%20scope.jpeg)

the marksman<br/>
waits by the window pane<br/>
through thin blinds<br/>
staring and at the mirror<br/>
of digital ecology<br/>
and twenty first century<br/>
cross-cultural economics ::<br/>
is it windows<br/>
or a mirror that<br/>
youâ€™re looking out of?
