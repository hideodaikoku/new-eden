# the sea
![the sea](images/the%20sea.jpeg)

we yearn for days
beyond steel and concrete
and flock on to the oceanside
the west coast paradise
the sunny days, so deeply displaced
by the sea, her windows unveil
and gaze beyond horizons, 
footsteps sinking into silting sand
leaving everything behind
knee deep in salty water
I breathe, a sigh of relief
for I know that riptides and deep waters
keep me from the horizon
the sea, she who eludes me
her freedom is her greatest illusion
I cannot pray step much further
for now I miss the impasse 
of steel and concrete walls
