# the sea
![the sea](images/the%20sea.jpeg)

we yearn for days<br/>
beyond steel and concrete<br/>
and flock on to the oceanside<br/>
the west coast paradise<br/>
the sunny days, so deeply displaced<br/>
by the sea, her windows unveil<br/>
and gaze beyond horizons,<br/> 
footsteps sinking into silting sand<br/>
leaving everything behind<br/>
knee deep in salty water<br/>
I breathe, a sigh of relief<br/>
for I know that riptides and deep waters<br/>
keep me from the horizon<br/>
the sea, she who eludes me<br/>
her freedom is her greatest illusion<br/>
I cannot pray step much further<br/>
for now I miss the impasse<br/> 
of steel and concrete walls<br/>
