The winning team always loses<br/>
Breathe the air of discontent<br/>
For true succor comes from within<br/>
Wisdom, care and compassion<br/>
Life itself and the passions that spring from it<br/>
The winning team understands desire<br/>
And the heavy heart of sacrifice<br/>
One must lose until one reaches the finish line<br/>
Life itself is brilliant, its light will shine the way<br/>
The winning team understands<br/>
The loneliness of the long distance runner<br/>
Shadow come closer as the runner<br/>
Goes further<br/>
