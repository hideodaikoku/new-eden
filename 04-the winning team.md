The winning team always loses
Breathe the air of discontent
For true succor comes from within
Wisdom, care and compassion
Life itself and the passions that spring from it
The winning team understands desire
And the heavy heart of sacrifice
One must lose until one reaches the finish line
Life itself is brilliant, its light will shine the way
The winning team understands
The loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadow come closer as the runner
Goes further
