# amphibian

![amphibian](images/amphibian.jpeg)

the amphibian small and quick
docile to the touch, just inches
away from being consumed
by the poisons of the swamp
it changes color to blend in
twitching left and right in
search of predators
and higher ground
the toxins deep, now spread
to the treetops
