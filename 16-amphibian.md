# amphibian

![amphibian](images/amphibian.jpeg)

the amphibian small and quick</br>
docile to the touch, just inches</br>
away from being consumed</br>
by the poisons of the swamp</br>
it changes color to blend in</br>
twitching left and right in</br>
search of predators</br>
and higher ground</br>
the toxins deep, now spread</br>
to the treetops</br>
