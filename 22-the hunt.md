*Paolo Uccello - The Hunt In The Forest 1470*

the hunt begins with an arrow in the sky</br>
the Boar, knows he must run</br>
for the game must be played</br>
three wolves run through the thicket</br>
weaving in and out of the woodwork</br>
the tiger must deliver the final blow</br>
so his cubs and maiden do all the work</br>
the beast, birds and monkeys</br> 
scout from above</br>
the forest floor rumbles, for the trees</br> 
speak in networks</br>
the boar trips on a vine, stumbles</br>
and twists his head and breathes a final sigh</br>
just circumstance, but now the wolves,</br>
tiger and his crew can triumph</br>
the hunt is over, they won</br>
the forest breathes, anticipating</br>
rain, dust and sunny days
