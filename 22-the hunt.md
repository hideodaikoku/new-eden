*Paolo Uccello - The Hunt In The Forest 1470*

the hunt begins with an arrow in the sky
the Boar, knows he must run
for the game must be played
three wolves run through the thicket
weaving in and out of the woodwork
the tiger must deliver the final blow
so his cubs and maiden do all the work
the beast, birds and monkeys 
scout from above
the forest floor rumbles, for the trees 
speak in networks
the boar trips on a vine, stumbles
and twists his head and breathes a final sigh
just circumstance, but now the wolves,
tiger and his crew can triumph
the hunt is over, they won
the forest breathes, anticipating
rain, dust and sunny days
