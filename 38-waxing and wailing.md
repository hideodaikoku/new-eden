# waxing and wailing
![waxing and wailing](images/waxing%20and%20wailing.jpeg)

on a precipice<br/>
night in and day out<br/>
far from the moon<br/>
waxing the floor till it wanes<br/>
lone wolf<br/>
raises his head<br/>
screaming into the abyss<br/>
we sit quietly<br/>
modulate the echoes<br/>
filter the noise<br/>
and see the Void<br/>
for what it truly is<br/>
the beauty and the pain
