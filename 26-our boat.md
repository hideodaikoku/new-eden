# our boat
![our boat](images/our%20boat.png)

our boat is tiny,
maybe just large enough
for a cocktail party
we row, slowly, but steadily
from lighthouse to light house
and sometimes the waves 
turn us upside down,
some of us don’t know how to swim
but we can learn
there’s driftwood in the distance
and something gleams against the sunlight
42 knots, it’s time to stop rowing
and let the wind carry us
to the beach
