# our boat
![our boat](images/our%20boat.png)

our boat is tiny,</br>
maybe just large enough</br>
for a cocktail party</br>
we row, slowly, but steadily</br>
from lighthouse to light house</br>
and sometimes the waves</br> 
turn us upside down,</br>
some of us don’t know how to swim</br>
but we can learn</br>
there’s driftwood in the distance</br>
and something gleams against the sunlight</br>
42 knots, it’s time to stop rowing</br>
and let the wind carry us</br>
to the beach
