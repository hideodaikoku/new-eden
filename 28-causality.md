Systems are composed</br>
Of rituals</br>
In nodes and edges</br>
Not all nodes are weighted equally</br>
And not all edges are unidirectional</br>
The system is true</br>
So long as its starting assumptions</br>
Hold true,</br>
analogous to digital signals</br>
that fluctuate in and out,</br>
Of tiny vibrations in the ether</br>
So step back and admire</br>
The beauty of the system</br>
What came first?</br>
The chicken or the nugget?</br>
