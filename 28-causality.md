![causality](images/causality.png)

Systems are composed
Of rituals
In nodes and edges
Not all nodes are weighted equally
And not all edges are unidirectional
The system is true
So long as its starting assumptions
Hold true,
analogous to digital signals
that fluctuate in and out,
Of tiny vibrations in the ether
So step back and admire
The beauty of the system
What came first?
The chicken or the nugget?
