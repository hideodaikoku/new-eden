*Image: John Fruscianteâ€™s Enclosure*

your mind is a<br/>
self-inscribing enclosure<br/>
twisting and turning, <br/>
yet still breathing<br/>
sometimes moving, <br/>
sometimes suspended<br/>
i wish you could see <br/>
the water at its source<br/>
what was once pure now full<br/>
of sediment in sentiment<br/>
cool fluid at the <br/>
troughs of your hands<br/>
yet all you see is a reflection<br/>
of the people you<br/> 
wished we could be<br/>
but what good is an image<br/>
without the light of a falling sun?<br/>
