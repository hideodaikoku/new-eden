the strong and righteous</br>
stand bright atop the hill</br>
on a golden arc</br>
brandishing the holy word</br>
staff in one hand, scripture in another</br>
yet as we look down on this painting</br>
we see the hill, bloodied by the</br>
toils of the weak and dark</br>
but they are free now.</br>
hell is the land of freedom</br>
physical torture is much more forgiving</br>
from the soul crushing omnipotence</br>
of pacifism
