the people of the city</br>
unite against villany,</br>
lest they bend the knee</br> 
the hero must therefore turn</br>
into a villain of his own making</br>
using fear to fight crime</br>
in the city, the mayhem</br> 
and mass hysteria</br> 
of the evening news</br>
the good people</br>
still shine a beacon into the sky
