# moonlight
![moonlight](images/moonlight.png)

Thereâ€™s two moons in the air<br/>
Dangling by a thread<br/>
Twisted and turning<br/> 
Colliding into each other<br/>
They speak in tongues<br/>
Without much knowledge<br/>
Of when and how they came to be<br/>
I look into the horizon<br/>
And watch from afar<br/>
For somebody has to stay back<br/>
And tend to the wheat grass<br/>
