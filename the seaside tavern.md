salt water taffy is delicious
at the seaside tavern
where three friends gathered
once a year to celebrate
the crane, the crab and the frog
the crane ordered yellowtail
with flowers on a stone bed
the crab ordered caviar and some juicy
shrimp, for he had come from a long day
the frog looked at both of their plates
and decided that today was the day
he wouldnâ€™t eat marsh water flies
salt water taffy was enough
in the company of his two best friends
