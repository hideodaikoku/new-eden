# vortex
![vortex](images/vortex.jpeg)

there is nothing more<br/>
subtle than grains of sand<br/>
flowing in the opposite direction<br/>
of a vortex<br/>
make the storm flow<br/>
in between your fingers<br/>
into a tiny fist full of sand<br/>
watch it rise up<br/>
to the surface<br/>
we must stand united
