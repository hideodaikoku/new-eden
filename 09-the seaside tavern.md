salt water taffy is delicious</br>
at the seaside tavern</br>
where three friends gathered</br>
once a year to celebrate</br>
the crane, the crab and the frog</br>
the crane ordered yellowtail</br>
with flowers on a stone bed</br>
the crab ordered caviar and some juicy</br>
shrimp, for he had come from a long day</br>
the frog looked at both of their plates</br>
and decided that today was the day</br>
he wouldnâ€™t eat marsh water flies</br>
salt water taffy was enough</br>
in the company of his two best friends</br>
