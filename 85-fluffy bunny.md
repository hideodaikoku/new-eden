# fluffy bunny
![fluffy bunny](images/fluffy%20bunny.jpeg)

i looked out of the<br/>
window and saw a <br/>
fluffy bunny, burrowing<br/>
holes into a small cubby<br/>
basket basin bowl<br/>
beneath the ocean tunnel<br/>
waiting for the cool<br/>
air to wash us away<br/>
the currents<br/>
feel the same
