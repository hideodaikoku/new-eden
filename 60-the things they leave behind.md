# the things they leave behind
![the things they leave behind](images/the%20things%20they%20leave%20behind.jpeg)

a photo album<br/>
of sorts, with<br/> 
memories from a<br/> 
world where<br/>
everything not saved<br/>
would be lost, a window<br/>
to a time when<br/>
an ink blot could<br/>
say more than<br/>
the words around it
