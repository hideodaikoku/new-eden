# golden arc
![golden arc](images/golden%20arc.jpeg)

the strong and righteous
stand bright atop the hill
on a golden arc
brandishing the holy word
staff in one hand, scripture in another
yet as we look down on this painting
we see the hill, bloodied by the
toils of the weak and dark
but they are free now.
hell is the land of freedom
physical torture is much more forgiving
from the soul crushing omnipotence
of pacifism
