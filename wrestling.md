colors of freedom
liberty and democracy
run deep in the jingoism
of daily interactions, 
the quest for freedom
the desire for order
but chaos and control
simply two wrestlers
in a match, liking fighting vipers
one taps out until the next round
and then itâ€™s back to bloodied noses
with broken teeth, with 
different colors next round
