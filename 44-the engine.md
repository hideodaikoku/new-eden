# the engine
![the engine](images/the%20engine.jpeg)

tiny moving parts<br/>
connected in perpetual motion<br/>
if I could just twist, one lever<br/>
two cogs and a dial,<br/>
let the steam run free<br/>
the water, cool and calm<br/>
collected into pools so the<br/>
animals could nestle<br/>
under the shade of an<br/>
ivy colored, rust bucket.<br/>
two crows sit side by side<br/>
on the power lines
