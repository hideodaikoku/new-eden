can you hear it?</br>
`i don’t hear it`</br>
listen closely</br>
`i still don’t hear it`</br>
listen with your eyes.</br>
`the trees?`</br>
look closer</br>
`the birds? the bees? what is it?`</br>
lean back</br>
`is it the forest? the sun? the stars?`</br>
look into the water</br>
`i hear it now! `</br>
keep listening :)
