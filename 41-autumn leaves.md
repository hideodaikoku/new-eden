*Apple Core by Claes Oldenburg*

I sat on the park bench,
Eating an apple
With some homemade lemonade
And had a conversation with the wind
It showed me the seasons
As the leaves changed color
The park and its animals
Foraging for nuts and berries
A coin that didnâ€™t make it 
Into the wishing well
And the wet footprints of the morning jogger
Big plastic candy wrapper
Wind cheating wind breaker
Of the morning raker
The bench was worn on the edges
From the many conversations
In the wind
I smiled, tipped my baseball cap
in reverence to the park bench
It's not easy being friends with the wind
I just hope the appleseeds 
make their way back home
