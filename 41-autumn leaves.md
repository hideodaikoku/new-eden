*Apple Core by Claes Oldenburg*

I sat on the park bench,<br/>
Eating an apple<br/>
With some homemade lemonade<br/>
And had a conversation with the wind<br/>
It showed me the seasons<br/>
As the leaves changed color<br/>
The park and its animals<br/>
Foraging for nuts and berries<br/>
A coin that didnâ€™t make it <br/>
Into the wishing well<br/>
And the wet footprints of the morning jogger<br/>
Big plastic candy wrapper<br/>
Wind cheating wind breaker<br/>
Of the morning raker<br/>
The bench was worn on the edges<br/>
From the many conversations<br/>
In the wind<br/>
I smiled, tipped my baseball cap<br/>
in reverence to the park bench<br/>
It's not easy being friends with the wind<br/>
I just hope the appleseeds<br/> 
make their way back home
